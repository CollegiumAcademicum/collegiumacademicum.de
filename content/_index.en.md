<p style="text-align: justify;">
  We are about 20 volunteers, working since 2013 to create a self-managed collective housing project for 220 young people. Inspired by the former Collegium Academicum (CA), which existed in Heidelberg until the 1970s, we want to create a place that makes it possible for students, trainees and doctoral students to live cheaply, self-managed and to experiment with cooperative and ecological forms of living. Our aim is to make democracy tangible, to encourage cultural and social exchange and to foster civic engagement, all in a context of mutual education. The first residents are expected to move into the building - currently under construction - at the end of 2021. The construction of the solid wood building takes place on the site of the former US barracks "US Hospital" in Heidelberg-Rohrbach (Baden-Württemberg, Germany). <a href="{{< relref path="pages/unterstuetzen/direktkredite/" lang="en" >}}">How to support the project?</a>
