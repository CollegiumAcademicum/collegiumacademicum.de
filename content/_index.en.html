title: "Collegium Academicum"

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Since 2013, we have been working as a volunteer project group to create affordable, self-managed and ecologically
  sound housing for over 250 people on the conversion site "US Hospital" in Heidelberg.
  This includes a new four-story wooden building, which, building on the basic idea of the "Collegium Academicum" (CA)
  dormitory that existed in Heidelberg's old town until the 1970s, will provide affordable and self-determined living
  for 176 students, trainees, and doctoral candidates, as well as making democracy tangible and promoting cultural and
  social exchange in an educational context.
  The first residents of the new wooden building are scheduled to move in in September 2022.
  <br>
  In addition, starting in winter 2023, approximately 50 young people will live in community in an adjacent old
  building as part of an orientation year. In addition, eight apartments will create further living space in this
  building, six of which will be rent-controlled social housing.
  The two large buildings will be complemented by a former gatehouse, which will house a self-managed café that will
  be open as a meeting place for the residents and the district.
