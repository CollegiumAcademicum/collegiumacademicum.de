<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Since 2013, we have been working as a volunteer project group to create affordable, self-managed and ecologically
  sound housing for over 250 people on the conversion site "US Hospital" in Heidelberg.
  <br<br>
  In doing so, we are building directly on the basic ideas of the "Collegium Academicum" (CA) dormitory that existed in
  Heidelberg's old town until the 1970s: Democratic organisation, socially critical thinking, self-managed living and
  diverse educational and cultural events.
  <br><br>
  Our project includes a new four-storey <a href="{{< relref path="/pages/wohnen/wohnheim" lang="en" >}}">wooden building</a>
  that provides affordable and self-determined housing for 176 students, trainees and doctoral students.
  The first 176 residents of the new wooden building moved in in February 2023.
  <br><br>
  In addition, starting in winter 2023/2024, approximately 50 young people will live in community in an adjacent old
  building as part of an <a href="https://faltr.de/">}}">orientation year</a>.
  In addition, eight apartments will create further living space in this building, six of which will be
  <a href="{{< relref path="/pages/wohnen/mietwohnraum" lang="en" >}}">rent-controlled social housing</a>.
  You can move in with us if you have a housing entitlement certificate!
  <br><br>
  The two large buildings will be complemented by a former gatehouse, which will house a self-managed café that will
  be open as a meeting place for the residents and the district.
