    With this conference, we want to open up a space for learning, encounter, and action in order to draw attention to the occupation of Western Sahara, the Sahrawi resistance, and the struggle for independence and self-determination, and to open spaces for discussions. We want to learn with and from each other and together create a place where people from different contexts, the Sahrawi community and diaspora, activists, academics, and institutional actors can network. We want to develop common perspectives and think collectively about what we can do here and now to build and strengthen solidarity networks. We want to raise our voices—for human rights, self-determination, and a life in freedom—without occupation and exploitation, for a life in dignity, and for a liberated, independent Western Sahara.

<h2>Conference content and formats</h2>

<div style="text-align: justify">
The conference invites participants to engage with the history and present situation of the Sahrawi people—their struggles, hopes, and voices. Over three days, a space for listening, exchange, and solidarity will be created, in which knowledge, culture, and lived experience will enter into dialogue with one another. The program ranges from the historical roots of the conflict over Western Sahara to current political, social, and human issues: How do people live in the camps? What forms of resistance and self-determination arise under occupation? What responsibility does Europe bear—politically, economically, morally? And what avenues are opening up for joint action? There will be various formats and approaches:


- Panels, readings, and discussions open up perspectives from activists, lawyers, artists, and journalists—from the camps, the occupied territories, and the diaspora.  
- Workshops create space for personal engagement and concrete solidarity.
- Evening cultural program: Film and music bring voices and stories to life in a different way—touching, impressive, and connecting.
- Shared meals and open discussions invite participants to form relationships and continue the exchange.
- The joint conclusion with a rally, music, and speeches sends a message of visibility, solidarity, and hope.


With the various formats, we want to create a lively, open conference that not only informs but also moves – and shows that solidarity across borders is possible.

<b>08:00 - 09:00</b>: Breakfast
- Breakfast together in the auditorium

<br>
<b>09:30 - 11:00</b>: Reading with tea ceremony

- With the comic ‘Genug gewartet’ (Enough Waiting), Fine (author and illustrator) takes you on a journey to Western Sahara and sheds light on the historical and political background of Africa's last colony. The reading is accompanied by a tea ceremony and offers an introduction to the topics of the weekend. 
Afterwards, there will be an opportunity to talk with a representative of the Sahrawi diaspora.

<b>11:30 – 13:00</b>: Perspective Resistance: Panel Discussion

- The resistance of the Sahrawi people is diverse, ongoing and everywhere: whether in the occupied territories, the camps or in the diaspora. In a panel discussion, voices from different geographical areas of the Sahrawi resistance will share their perspectives. 


<b>13:00 – 14:00</b>: Lunch break

- Lunch together

<b>4:30 – 15:30 Uhr</b>: Resources and Trade

- Why is Western Sahara so important to Morocco? How do Europe and Germany benefit from the occupation? A presentation by Western Sahara Resource Watch will address the illegal exploitation of resources in occupied Western Sahara, international trade relations, and the involvement of German companies in the occupation.


<b>15:30 – 16:00</b>: Coffee break

<b>16:00 – 17:00</b>: Workshop phase

- The workshop phase will offer various opportunities to take concrete action, build networks or explore connections to other freedom struggles. 
More information about the planned workshops will follow.

<b>17:30 – 18:30 Uhr</b>: Zine reading

- After the workshop phase, we will return to a shared space. In the zine WIDERWORTE, Sahrawi voices from the occupied territories, refugee camps and the European diaspora interweave to form a shared counter-narrative. We will round off the day with a short reading followed by a discussion with one of the authors.

<b>18:30 – 20:00</b>: Dinner together


<b>20:00 – 21:30 Uhr</b>: Panel discussion – International responsibility

- What is the role of Germany, the EU and the UN with regard to Western Sahara? Where does the responsibility lie? We want to discuss these questions with politicians who work on the issue in various institutions and, above all, ask: What needs to change in politics to achieve a liberated Western Sahara? 

<b>21:30 – open end</b>: Closing with music

- We will end the evening with music together. We are currently working on organising a Sahrawi artist or band.

<br>

<b>08:00 – 10:00</b>: Breakfast together

<b>10:00 – 11:30 Uhr</b>: Panel discussion on life in the camps

- For 50 years, a large part of the Sahrawi people have been living in camps in the Algerian desert. What is life like there? What is the role of women in the construction and administration of the camps? Why is climate justice a central concept in the Sahrawi resistance?
Sahrawi activists from the camps will report on these issues and discuss them with us.


<b>11:30 – 13:00</b>: The role of the media – an insight

- From the Moroccan media blockade to the inadequate international and German reporting to the self-empowerment of Sahrawi media from the occupied territories, the camps and the diaspora, the role of the media permeates all levels of resistance and occupation. We will gain insights and input on various aspects, with the opportunity to discuss the role of the German media afterwards. 


<b>From 13:00</b>: Joint lunch and official end

- After a full and busy weekend, we will conclude with a joint meal. There will be further opportunity for open discussion.

<b>Afternoon</b>: Joint protest
We're taking what we've learned to the streets! Together, we want to protest in Heidelberg and show that a Heidelberg-based company is also profiting from the occupation of Western Sahara. More information to follow.
