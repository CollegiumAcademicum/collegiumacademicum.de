    With this conference, we want to open up a space for learning, encounter, and action in order to draw attention to the occupation of Western Sahara, the Sahrawi resistance, and the struggle for independence and self-determination, and to open spaces for discussions. We want to learn with and from each other and together create a place where people from different contexts, the Sahrawi community and diaspora, activists, academics, and institutional actors can network. We want to develop common perspectives and think collectively about what we can do here and now to build and strengthen solidarity networks. We want to raise our voices—for human rights, self-determination, and a life in freedom—without occupation and exploitation, for a life in dignity, and for a liberated, independent Western Sahara.
</div>

<h2>Conference content and formats</h2>

<div style="text-align: justify">
The conference invites participants to engage with the history and present situation of the Sahrawi people—their struggles, hopes, and voices. Over three days, a space for listening, exchange, and solidarity will be created, in which knowledge, culture, and lived experience will enter into dialogue with one another. The program ranges from the historical roots of the conflict over Western Sahara to current political, social, and human issues: How do people live in the camps? What forms of resistance and self-determination arise under occupation? What responsibility does Europe bear—politically, economically, morally? And what avenues are opening up for joint action? There will be various formats and approaches:


- Panels, readings, and discussions open up perspectives from activists, lawyers, artists, and journalists—from the camps, the occupied territories, and the diaspora.  
- Workshops create space for personal engagement and concrete solidarity.
- Evening cultural program: Film and music bring voices and stories to life in a different way—touching, impressive, and connecting.
- Shared meals and open discussions invite participants to form relationships and continue the exchange.
- The joint conclusion with a rally, music, and speeches sends a message of visibility, solidarity, and hope.


With the various formats, we want to create a lively, open conference that not only informs but also moves – and shows that solidarity across borders is possible.

<b>13:00 – 14:00</b>: Lunch break

<b>14:30 – 15:30 Uhr</b>: Resources and Trade

<b>10:00 – 11:30 Uhr</b>: Panel discussion on life in the camps

- For 50 years, a large part of the Sahrawi people have been living in camps in the Algerian desert. What is life like there? What is the role of women in the construction and administration of the camps? Why is climate justice a central concept in the Sahrawi resistance?
**Najla Mohamedlamin Salma, Asria Mohamed und Taleb Brahim Sidimohamed** will report on these issues and discuss them with us.


<b>11:30 – 13:00</b>: The role of the media – an insight

- From the Moroccan media blockade to the inadequate international and German reporting to the self-empowerment of Sahrawi media from the occupied territories, the camps and the diaspora, the role of the media permeates all levels of resistance and occupation. We will gain insights and input on various aspects, with the opportunity to discuss the role of the German media afterwards (**with contributions from Sahrawi Voice, Equipe Media, Nanna Maarouf, Jörg Tidien and others**).
