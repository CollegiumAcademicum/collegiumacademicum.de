### What the members of the Heidelberg City Council say about the project of the Collegium Academicum:

> We support the residential, cultural and educational project Collegium Academicum. The model project is creating a real laboratory in which students and young people from Heidelberg can try out their ideas, broaden their horizons and take on responsibility. In this way, the city will be enriched and will strengthen its profile as a university town and starting point for inspiration.
