<!-- We are a team of young people planning the new house of Collegium Academicum (CA) together. The team and the idea for the project both emerged in Plöck 93, a self-managed house community. This house is maintained since 1985 by a non-profit Association _Collegium Academicum Heidelberg e.V._[^1] in order to give students the possibility to educate themselves and get involved beyond their studies. Being successor of the [former CA](/geschichte) that existed from 1945 to 1978 in Seminarstraße 2, the Association acts as a link between generations and encourages the exchange of experiences.-->

<p style="text-align:justify">
Our team is motivated, active and open. We see ourselves as designers and facilitators of the future dormitory. We <a href="{{< relref "/pages/unterstuetzen/mach-mit" >}}">invite everybody interested</a> to participate in our project. <a href="{{< relref "/pages/ueber-uns/unser-leitbild" >}}">Our vision</a> summarises the goals and principles governing our living together.
<br><br>
The focus of the new CA is on <a href="{{< relref "/pages/hausprojekt/bildung" >}}">education</a>, because we strongly believe that education is the basis for a functioning and open society. People who are mature and critical thinkers can lead a self-determined life and take action for a just and forward-looking society. We want to contribute and to take responsibility with an interdisciplinary and reflective educational program that is based on practical experience.
<br><br>
Many different people have actively worked on the project in the past.
