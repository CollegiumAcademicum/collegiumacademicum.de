With a donation you directly support the CA as an educational project. This includes educational events in the new building such as lectures, workshops or readings. Specifically, you enable practical learning spaces, for example in the <a href="https://faltr.de/">falt*r orientation year</a> and in our wood, metal and bicycle workshops, where residents and interested parties from the neighbourhood can realise their own projects. 
Since 2020, <a href="https://collegiumacademicum.de/aktionen/">work camps</a> with young volunteers have regularly taken place on our construction site, which the Förderverein has subsidised.

If you are interested in donating, please contact us and write to href="mailto:spenden@collegiumacademicum.de">spenden@collegiumacademicum.de</a>. You can find further information here on our <a href="/media/2023_Spendenflyer_digital.pdf">donations flyer</a> (_in German_).

    Donations for the project are possible through the Association of Collegium Academicum, Förderverein Collegium Academicum Heidelberg e.V. The goal of this Association is to promote interdisciplinary education. The members of the Association are mostly members of the former Collegium Academicum, members of the project team and patrons of the project. Together, they create free space for young people, in intellectual as well as material terms.

    The association currently supports the Collegium Academicum primarily in its educational work. Lectures, training courses and workshops. Above all, however, the association is responsible for planning and organising the <a href="https://faltr.de/">orientation year</a>, which offers young people an insight into the basics of various academic, professional and personal development opportunities after leaving school.
