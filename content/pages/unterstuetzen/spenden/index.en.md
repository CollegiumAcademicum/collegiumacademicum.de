By donating you directly support the new building of the CA as an educational project. You help to create a learning environment where students directly participate in shaping and building it. For example, we have got a CNC milling machine which was bought with support by the IKEA-foundation, and we will build the furniture for the dormitory ourselves. The materials for this are co-financed by donations. In 2020 and 2021, carried out several international work camps with young volunteers which will be co-sponsored by our Association. In the new house, the workshop room will be set up permanently, so that future residents can realise their own projects. As we try to save resources, we are also happy to accept in-kind donations.

Currently we are particularly interested in donations of well-preserved furniture in order to furnish the rooms and common areas. If you are interested, please get in touch with us.

You can find further information here on our <a href="/media/2019_Spenden-Flyer.pdf">donations flyer</a> (_in German_).

    The Association currently assists in the construction of the new CA house, in particular in the areas of educational work and own construction contributions. This helps us to develop presentations, training courses and workshops as well as concepts for a tutorials program in the new CA.
    <br>
    For example, members of our project group learn how to operate the CNC milling machine so that they can use it for their own construction work.
