## HammerCAmps 2023

The move into the new building is complete, but the next milestone, the completion of our old building, is still to come, so that in a few months our orientation year [falt*r](https://faltr.de/home) and social housing will find a place there.

Therefore, this summer we invite you to five spectacular "HammerCAmps.
* **HammerCAmp** 1: 03.07. to 09.07.2023.
* **HammerCAmp** 2: 17.07. to 23.07.2023
* **HammerCAmp** 3: 31.07. to 06.08.2023
* **HammerCAmp** 4: 14.08. to 20.08.2023
* **HammerCAmp** 5: 04.09. to 10.09.2023

The focus will be on work in the interior and the furnishing of the old building. The whole thing will be complemented by communal vegan breakfast, lunch and dinner (on a donation basis). There will also be space for workshops, excursions, film evenings, one or two parties and general leisure time together.
