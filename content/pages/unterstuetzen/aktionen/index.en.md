## Workcamps for the old building in February and March 🛠️

The first great people were able to move into our renovated old building at the end of January.
In order for the next residents to move in soon, we have to lend a hand once again and complete the last important work.

There will be two work camp weeks again in February and March.

Look forward to good conversations, lots of fun and a bit of nonsense  😇 🎵 🥳

Helpers are of course invited to lunch (on a voluntary donation basis), which is freshly prepared by us every day.

We will mainly be painting walls and, if our capacities are sufficient, milling wood and building furniture from it.
There is also always some minor building cleaning work to be done.

The meeting point is Mendelejewplatz 1 (between the new and old buildings), 69126 Heidelberg-Rohrbach

To register, simply send us an informal email to kontakt@collegiumacademicum.de or give us a call on +49 (0)6221 652236.

You can help out for a few hours, for individual days or for a whole week.

## HammerCAmps 2023

The move into the new building is complete, but the next milestone, the completion of our old building, is still to come, so that in a few months our orientation year [falt*r](https://faltr.de/home) and social housing will find a place there.

Therefore, this summer we invite you to five spectacular "HammerCAmps.
* **HammerCAmp** 1: 03.07. to 09.07.2023.
* **HammerCAmp** 2: 17.07. to 23.07.2023
* **HammerCAmp** 3: 31.07. to 06.08.2023
* **HammerCAmp** 4: 14.08. to 20.08.2023
* **HammerCAmp** 5: 04.09. to 10.09.2023

The focus will be on work in the interior and the furnishing of the old building. The whole thing will be complemented by communal vegan breakfast, lunch and dinner (on a donation basis). There will also be space for workshops, excursions, film evenings, one or two parties and general leisure time together.
