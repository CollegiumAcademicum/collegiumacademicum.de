Special attention will be paid to the topics of democracy promotion, possibilities for shaping society and social-ecological sustainability.
The theoretical as well as practical elaboration of these complexes of topics is intended to encourage an intensive examination and a holistic view.
<br><br>
For us, living in a community is also part of our own further development.
The renovated and modernised old building right next to our dormitory houses single and double rooms for a total of 50 participants, three large seminar rooms and a bicycle and metal workshop.
