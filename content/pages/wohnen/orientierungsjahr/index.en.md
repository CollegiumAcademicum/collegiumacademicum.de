With the orientation year falt*r, we want to enable young people to develop freely between school and their further
path in life and create space and time for personal growth and interdisciplinary further education.

Special attention will be paid to the topics of democracy promotion, possibilities for shaping society and social-ecological sustainability.
The theoretical as well as practical elaboration of these complexes of topics is intended to encourage an intensive examination and a holistic view.
<br><br>
For us, living in a community is also part of our own further development.
The renovated and modernised old building right next to our dormitory houses single and double rooms for a total of 50 participants, three large seminar rooms and a bicycle and metal workshop.

On the falt*r website and on our Instagram page you can find more information, including the application procedure, the programme and the team.
