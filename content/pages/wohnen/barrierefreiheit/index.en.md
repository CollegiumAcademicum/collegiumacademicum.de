On the site of the former US hospital in Heidelberg-Rohrbach, there is a new wooden building and an old building that is currently being renovated. Both buildings offer living space for different target groups.
During construction and renovation, emphasis was placed on <b>making the living space barrier-free</b>.
<br><br>
The new wooden building offers living space for a total of 176 students, trainees and doctoral students.
The rooms are grouped into 3-person and 4-person shared flats, and each has its own bathroom and kitchen.
<br><br>
Next to it is the old building, a former administrative building of the hospital, in which six social rental flats will be set up. These are located on the ground floor, which can be accessed barrier-free.
<br><br>
In the following, we have summarised the most important information on accessibility in the new and old building.
</p>

### Access to the house and the apartments

<p style="text-align:justify">
Access to the house and the residential units is barrier-free in both the new and the old building.
<br><br>
The new building and all indoor common areas are accessible barrier-free.
The flats can be reached with outside balcony corridors and an elevator (door width min. 90 cm, inner width 110 cm and depth 210 cm, single-sided access).
The elevator door has no thresholds, the pushbuttons are visually and haptically marked, and it has a voice output. The entrances to the flats are flush with the floor and 125 cm wide.
Steps in the building and paths through the building are marked.
<!--All doors inside the flats have a minimum width of 90 cm and do not have a threshold. The bath door opens to the outside.-->
<br><br>
A ramp was built on the south side of the building for access to the old building.
<!-- Barrierefreie Wohneinheiten im Altbau befinden sich sowohl im Erd- als auch im ersten Obergeschoss. -->
Four residential units are located on the ground floor and are accessible via the common areas.
Two further residential units are located on the first floor and are accessible via a stair lift.
<br><br>
A total of 902.89 m<sup>2</sup> of barrier-free access was created with the communal areas and residential units on the ground floor and first floor of the old building.
</p>

### Access to rooms
<p style="text-align:justify">
Access to the residential units of the new and old building is made possible by adapting the doors and floors.
In this regard, the width of the doors has been adapted and thresholds outside and inside the living spaces have been avoided.
In addition, the residential units have sufficient space for movement and turning.
</p>

### BÃ¤der
<p style="text-align:justify">
The bathrooms in the new building are all designed as identical, barrier-free prefabricated bathrooms.
The basis for this is the "Ready Standard" (<a href="https://www.readyhome.de/">www.readyhome.de</a>).
All bathrooms are prepared in such a way that they can easily be equipped with appropriate handles and brackets.
Four of the bathrooms were equipped with handles and brackets already from the start, incl. switch opening for the bathroom door. In all bathrooms, the toilets are approachable from only one side, in some rooms from the left, and in some from the right.
The sinks in the bathrooms are wheelchair approachable and the showers are also flat without threshold. The area is at least 120 cm x 120 cm.
<br><br>
The bathrooms in the old building are also accessible and usable without barriers, with an appropriate WC and sufficient space for moving and turning.
</p>

### Transport connection

<p style="text-align:justify">
The Collegium Academicum is right next to the tram stop "Ortenauer Str." <a href="/en/map/">How to get to us</a>.
According to the transport association, this is a stop with a platform height of 30 cm and has largely step-free, level access.
Furthermore, we will provide two designated handicapped-accessible parking spots with a width of 2.75 m.
