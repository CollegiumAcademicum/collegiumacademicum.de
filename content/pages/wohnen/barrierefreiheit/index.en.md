Our new four-story wooden dormitory on the area of the previous US army hospital in Heidelberg-Rohrbach provides accomodation for 176 students, apprentices, and doctoral students.
The rooms are organized in flats of three or four rooms with a shared kitchen and bathroom.
Accessibility was an explicit concern for us in the planning and the building is designed to be as barrier-free as possible.
Below we have summarized the most important information on accessibility.

### Access to the house and the flats

The complete house and all common areas are accessible barrier-free.
The flats can be reached with outside balcony corridors and an elevator (door width min. 90 cm, inner width 110 cm and depth 210 cm, single-sided access).

The elevator door has no thresholds, the pushbuttons are visually and haptically marked, and it has a voice output.
The entrances to the flats are flush with the floor and 125 cm wide.

Steps in the building and paths through the building are marked.

### Access to the rooms

All doors inside the flats have a minimum width of 90 cm and do not have a threshold.
The bath door opens to the outside.

### Bathrooms

The bathrooms are designed as identical, barrier-free ready-made units.
The basis for the concept is the "Ready-Standard" (https://readyhome.de).
All bathrooms are prepared in such a way that they can easily be equipped with appropriate handles and brackets.

Four of the bathrooms were equipped with handles and brackets already from the start, incl. switch
opening for the bathroom door. In all bathrooms, the toilets are approachable from only one side, in some rooms from the
left, and in some from the right.

The sinks in the bathrooms are wheelchair approachable and the showers are also flat without threshold.
The area is at least 120 cm x 120 cm.

### Public transport

The dormitory is right next to the tram stop "Ortenauer Str.".
Furthermore, we will provide two designated handicapped-accessible parking spots with a width of 2.75 m.
