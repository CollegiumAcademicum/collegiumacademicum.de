### Questions about the furnishing of the rooms and the dormitory

{{< accordion "How high is the rent?" >}}
A room in our dormitory costs a total of 345 € per month (315,20 € warm rent plus about 30 € costs for electricity and internet). The electricity costs of 21.50 € per month are paid in advance by each person, but the final costs are calculated at the end of the year based on actual use. As a self-managed housing project, we don't want to make a profit with the income, but instead we try to keep the rents as low as possible. You can get an overview of the project's funding [here](/en/funding).
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "How big are the rooms?" >}}
Each room is 14 m<sup>2</sup> and can be flexibly reduced to 7 m<sup>2</sup> to have more common space in the shared flat. The rent also includes the large common areas in the entire house, such as the large auditorium for more than 600 people, the workshop and the roof terrace.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "How many rooms are in each flat?" >}}
Most of the flats contain four rooms, but some contain only three, as well as a shared kitchen and bathroom.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "Which ancillary costs are included in the fixed rent?" >}}
The fixed rent includes heating, water and sewage costs. Additionally, the rent includes the maintenance costs of the building. The costs for electricity (around 21.50 €) and internet (7.50 €) are not contained in the fixed rent. Electricity is billed for each shared flat based on actual usage and the internet contract is set up centrally.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "Are the rooms 'barrier-free'?" >}}
Yes! All floors are accessible via elevator and the doors have flat thresholds and are wheelchair accessible. For now, only four flats on the ground floor are equipped with barrier-free bathrooms. It is possible to adapt all other flats in this way if required. If you need more specific information on accessibility, have a look at [this page](/en/accessibility) or contact us directly at einziehen@collegiumacademicum.de.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "Where do we buy our electricity?" >}}
We obtain our externally produced electricity from 100 % renewable energies via the <a href="https://heidelberger-energiegenossenschaft.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heidelberger Energiegenossenschaft</a> (Heidelberg Energy Cooperative). The electricity demand is largely covered by the photovoltaic system on our roof, including battery storage. Electricity costs are not included in the fixed rent.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "Does each flat have its own washing machine?" >}}
No, except the flatmates would pay and set up one themselves. The house has a separate central washing lounge with enough washing machines for all residents. We think a shared washing lounge is a more sufficient approach and saves all residents space and costs.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "How are the kitchens in the flats equipped?" >}}
Each kitchen comes equipped with a stove, oven, extractor hood, fridge, freezer and a kitchen top with a sink. Additionally, the kitchen has a table and chairs. All furniture is made in-house or acquired as donations!
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "Is there a WiFi connection?" >}}
Yes, the dormitory has a fast central internet connection (fiber optics) and all flats have their own WiFi access points. There is also a LAN connection for each WG. Residents do not have to get their own internet contracts.
{{< /accordion >}}

### Questions about the application

{{< accordion "When are there vacant rooms in the dormitory?" >}}
We are regularly looking for new residents to fill vacant rooms. Moving-in is always possible at the beginning of a quarter (October 1, January 1, April 1, and July 1). You can find the next move-in date [on this page](/en/dorm).
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "How does the application process work?" >}}
We would like to invite all applicants who have filled out the application form completely and answered the two questions to our application day. If we want to invite more applicants than can take part in the application day, we first assign places on the basis of a quota to enable apprentices in particular to take part in the application day. After that, we assign places by drawing lots. How many applicants can participate in the application day depends on our capacities, but also on how many rooms will become vacant in the dormitory. Therefore, we can only give you feedback after the application deadline whether you can participate in the application day.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "What does the application day look like?" >}}
About two weeks after the application deadline, the application day takes place. The intention of this day is to give you an insight into life in the CA and the structure of the self-government. It also allows us to get to know you better so that we can make an informed decision. We will first introduce the CA, followed by a group phase and a 15-minute individual interview.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "Can I participate online at the application day?" >}}
If you are invited to the application day, you are free to choose whether you want to participate on-site at the CA or online. We take care not to favor or disadvantage applicants because of their participation in presence or online. However, we recommend you to come to the application day in presence, if it's possible for you, so that you can get to know our project better.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "According to which criteria will the residents be chosen?" >}}
Given that the formal requirements are met (status as a student, doctoral student of trainee), we are searching for people that can identify with our mission statement, that want to engage in the self-organization of the dormitory and want to take up responsibility for the community. After the application day, we decide which applicants we would like to accept. If we want to accept more applicants than we have vacant rooms, we first assign acceptances on the basis of a quota to enable apprentices in particular to move into the CA. After that, we assign acceptances by drawing lots.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "Who organizes the application day and decides whether I can move in?" >}}
Responsible for the organization of the application process and for the selection of the residents is the Belegium. The Belegium is part of our self-administration. It consists of residents of the dormitory and is elected by them.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "What if I didn't get a place in the dormitory at the application day?" >}}
All selected applicants who have not received an acceptance can be added to our waiting list. We assign places via the waiting list if rooms become vacant at short notice before the next move-in date, but this will only happen in exceptional cases. So it is rather unlikely to get a place in the dormitory via the waiting list. The waiting list will be emptied after 3 months. You are allowed to reapply on every move-in date and you are always welcome to participate in our project independent of that.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "Can I apply even if I am not studying or doing an apprenticeship?" >}}
This is only possible in very few exceptional cases for people who are structurally strongly disadvantaged on the housing market and are in another type of training/study (e.g. German course, FSJ or similar). The particular disadvantage as well as the current main occupation must be briefly described in addition to the application informally via email to einziehen@collegiumacademicum.de.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "Is there an age restriction? Can I apply if I am not yet 18 years old? " >}}
Currently, for legal reasons, you must be at least 18 years old when you move in, but you can already apply before your 18th birthday.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "Does the application cost anything?" >}}
No, the application does not cost you anything. If you would like to participate in an on-site application day, you may incur costs for travel to and from the event, which you will have to pay yourself.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "I have supported the project by giving a direct loan before. Do I or my children/relatives have an advantage with moving in?" >}}
No! Financial support does not have any influence on who can move in. The financial background should not have any effect whether somebody can be part of this community or not.
{{< /accordion >}}

### Questions about moving in and living together

{{< accordion "Can I choose my flatmates?" >}}
If you are accepted for moving in, we will invite you to a WG finding day, where you can get to know the different WGs in which rooms become vacant. Afterwards, you can give feedback on which WGs you would or would not like to move into. Likewise, the WGs can give feedback. We try to take all wishes into account as good as possible.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "Can I bring my pet?" >}}
No, pets are not allowed in the dormitory. An exception to this are assistance pets.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "Can I bring my own furniture?" >}}
Each room is always rented furnished (desk, wardrobe, bed).
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "Does the house have special family flats for families with children?" >}}
There are no family flats in the strict sense. Nevertheless, it is possible to move into the residence with children. There are several options. A child can rent its own room in its own shared flat. It is also possible for two adults to share a room and use the room that becomes free as a children's room. Thanks to the flexible partition walls, individual room sizes are also possible. For example, one room can be divided into two smaller rooms of 7 square metres each, one of which would become a passage room.

### Questions about the furnishings of the rooms and the old building

{{< accordion "Where are the flats located?" >}}
Our 6 social rented flats and the 2 unsubsidised flats are located together with the orientation year
in our beautiful, energy-efficiently renovated old building right next to the dormitory.
Together we form a large community that decides on its living space together and manages it itself.
Four social rented flats are on the ground floor, two more on the 1st floor.
The two unsubsidised flats are on the 2nd and 3rd floors.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "How much is the rent?" >}}
For an overview of all the key data of the flats in the old building, including the amount of the rents, see [social rental housing](/en/rental-housing/) and [freely financed apartments](/en/freely_financed_apartments/).
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "What do the flats look like?" >}}
The flats vary in size and have different floor plans.
Under [social rental housing](/en/rental-housing/) and [freely financed apartments](/en/freely_financed_apartments/) you will find an overview of all the key data of the flats in the old building.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "Are the flats barrier-free/wheelchair accessible?" >}}
The flats on the ground floor are barrier-free.
If you need more information, please contact us at einziehen.altbau@collegiumacademicum.de.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "How much are the service charges?" >}}
The expected service charges differ between apartments. Under [social rental housing](/en/rental-housing/) and [freely financed apartments](/en/freely_financed_apartments/) you will find an overview of all the key data for the flats in the old building.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "Where is the electricity drawn from?" >}}
The old building uses 100% electricity from renewable sources via the Heidelberger Energiegenossenschaft.
To a large extent, the electricity demand is covered by the photovoltaic system on our roof, including battery storage.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "What basic amenities does a flat have?" >}}
Each flat has a (living) kitchen and one to two bathrooms (depending on size).
The washing machines and dryers are centrally located in the washing lounge of the neighbouring new building. This is more ecological,
space-saving, more effective and cheaper than having your own washing machine per flat.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "Is there internet access?" >}}
Yes, each flat has its own wifi and the common rooms in the old and new buildings have public wifi.
In addition, the CA has its own IT working group that provides various IT services for the entire CA.
{{< /accordion >}}

### Questions about the application
{{< accordion "Do I have to study or do an apprenticeship to apply for a room/flat in the old building?" >}}
No! This rule only applies to the neighbouring dormitory in the new building.
All people can apply for an apartment in the old building.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "When are rooms or flats in the old building ready for occupancy?" >}}
The flats are expected to be ready for occupation from 01.01.2024.
We always try to advertise vacant accommodation as soon as possible.
We plan to organise viewing and get-to-know-you days every now and then.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "How can I apply for one of the social rented flats?" >}}
You apply for one of our social rented flats at [this application form](/application_sowobau/).
Please note that in the 6 social rented flats only people are admitted to apply who have a
housing entitlement certificate for the current calendar year.
You can find detailed information on how to apply for this housing entitlement certificate from the city [here](https://www.heidelberg.de/hd,Lde/-/Verfahrensbeschreibung/;vbid1038/;vbmid1).

- [Orientation Year Application](https://faltr.de/)
- [Application for the hall of residence](/application)
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "How do I apply for one of the unsubsidised residences?" >}}
You apply for a flat in our old building at [this application form](/application_ffw/).
Note that there is a [different application form](/application_sowobau/) for the social rented flats.
If you want to apply for a place in the orientation year or in the dormitory, select the appropriate link:
- [application for the orientation year](https://faltr.de/)
- [Application for the hall of residence](/application)
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "I/We have given a direct loan. Does this give me/us an advantage when applying?" >}}
No, this does not affect the chances of applying.
Financial background should not be a factor in whether a person can live in a flat in CA.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "What criteria are used to select residents?" >}}
In addition to the formal requirements, we are looking for people who identify with our mission statement,
to take part in the self-administration and take responsibility for the housing project.
{{< /accordion >}}

### Questions about moving in and living together

{{< accordion "When is it possible to move into the old building?" >}}
We are currently assuming that we will be renting from January 2024.
However, as the building is still under construction, we can't put a definite move-in date yet.
If you would like to help out on the construction site, please feel free to contact us at collegiumacademicum@posteo.de.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "Will I be part of the housing project if I move into the old building?" >}}
Of course, you will be part of the project and take part in the self-management.
You are also allowed to share all available common areas with the other residents.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "What does it mean to participate in self-management?" >}}
The people who live in our buildings organise their living together and community.
This means that tasks such as financing/tenancy management and the maintenance of our living environment are borne by ourselves.
It is therefore important that all the people who live here together also participate in the self-administration according to their possibilities.
If you get involved in the project before you move in, you will also have the opportunity to play an even greater role in shaping your future living space!
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "Are the residents of the old building allowed to share common rooms in the old and new buildings?" >}}
Yes, the entire project is shared by all residents.
Areas within the flat (kitchen, bathroom...) are of course private.
But you have access to many common rooms: from the lounge to the conference room, to group rooms,
workrooms, wood-, metal- and bicycle workshop, garden, and laundry room.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "Do I need to give a direct loan or donate to move in?" >}}
No. A person's financial situation should not determine whether they can live in our project.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "We are several related people with/without child(ren)/I am a single parent with child(ren). I am a senior citizen. Can we or can I still move in?" >}}
When you first rent out your flat, we will only rent it out as a whole and not give out individual rooms.
In later phases of the project, it depends on whether a whole flat or a corresponding number of rooms becomes available.
In principle, living together in the old building is possible in all situations and we are looking forward to mixed flat-sharing communities!
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "Do I have to help on the construction site myself?" >}}
No. But we would very much like many residents to help even before they move in.
Maybe with the furniture, with the rent administration, with the financial work or maybe on our building site?
Support from residents is especially useful and desirable with regard to future self-administration,
in order to be able to live together. You can find more information under [Join us!](/mach-mit).
