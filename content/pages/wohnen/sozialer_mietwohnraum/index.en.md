<p style="text-align:justify">
Our old building combines a variety of living concepts. In this way, we want to bring together different lifestyles and enable even more people to participate in communal, self-managed living.
<br><br>
While the eastern part of the building is mainly intended for participants of the <a href="/orientation-year">Orientation Year</a>,
the ground floor and the west of our old building contain flats that can function as a whole rented flat or as a shared flat.
<!--In addition, all residents of our project can benefit from large, versatile communal areas inside and outside our buildings.-->
<br><br>
All flats have the following address:

Ossip-Mandelstam-Straße 1 \
69126 Heidelberg-Rohrbach
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
The majority of our flats in old buildings are subsidised by the <a href="https://mlw.baden-wuerttemberg.de/de/bauen-wohnen/wohnungsbau/wohnraumfoerderung/mietwohnraumfoerderung/">Social Rental Housing Subsidy of the State of Baden Württemberg</a>.
In addition to our other subsidies, this funding also ensures permanently affordable rents in our old building.
Six flats, four of them on the ground floor and two on the first floor, are expected to be let here from 01.02.2024.
<br><br>
You can find an overview with floor plans, room sizes and rent levels further down on this page.
<br><br>
<b>Important note:</b>
Unlike the adjacent new-build residential home, people of all ages and in all circumstances can move in here if they can present a housing entitlement certificate.
For more information on who is eligible to live in socially subsidised rental housing, see <a href="https://www.heidelberg.de/hd/-/Verfahrensbeschreibung/;vbid1038">here</a>.

<p style="text-align:justify">
The private living space is complemented by various rooms that are shared by the entire project:
Workshops, auditorium, multifunctional room, seminar rooms and workrooms.
There is also central internet and enough (garden) space to stroll around outside.
The building uses an ecological construction method: This includes an insulation standard of KfW 55,
interior walls made of straw, passive ventilation, triple-glazed windows and green electricity from its own roof.
<br><br>
It is not possible to rent the flat as a single person, as residential space is in scarce supply in Heidelberg and we would like to enable as many people as possible to live in our project.
<br><br>
Our housing project is self-managed. We are looking forward to your help in the self-administration within the frame of your possibilities.
For the residents of our older building, self-administration includes maintenance tasks (similar to a sweeping week).
In addition, you can help with tasks in the garden, in our workshops, in administration, public relations or educational work.
<br><br>
You should have a desire for a colourful house community and expect that with the orientation year located in the old building, there will be an annual change of young residents.
Due to our location on the conversion site of the US Hospital, there will soon be frequent construction sites around us, with the accompanying noise.
In addition, there is a large assembly hall in our new building next door, which is regularly used for events (parties and other evening events as well).
