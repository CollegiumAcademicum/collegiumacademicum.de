Would you like to get a taste of self-administration? Then you've come to the right place here at the ecological and
self-managed CA (Collegium Academicum) housing project. Our old building combines a variety of living concepts.
We want to bring together different living environments and enable even more people to participate in communal, self-managed living.
</p>

<div class="color-block">
<p style="text-align:justify">
The rooms advertised here are located on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd floors of our old building and are organized in corridor
communities. We rent the rooms for 6 months before they are used for our <a href="/orientierungsjahr">orientation year</a>
falt*r from fall 2024.
We are therefore looking for students, trainees or FSJ students who are looking for an interim rent for 6 months
and/or would like to get a taste of our housing project without obligation, are only in Heidelberg for half a year or
urgently need a room.

<p style="text-align:justify">

All rooms have the following address:

Ossip-Mandelstam-Straße 1 \
69126 Heidelberg-Rohrbach
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
An overview with floor plans, room sizes and rent levels can be found further down on this page.
<br><br>
The private living space is complemented by various rooms that are shared by the entire project:
Workshops, assembly hall, multifunctional room, seminar rooms and workrooms.
There is also central internet access and plenty of (garden) space for strolling around outside.
The building uses an ecological construction method: This includes an insulation standard of KfW 55, interior
walls made of straw, passive ventilation, triple-glazed windows and green electricity from its own roof.
<br><br>
ou should be in the mood for a colorful house community. Due to our location on the US hospital conversion site, there is currently often a building site around us with the associated noise. There is also a large assembly hall in our new building next door, which is regularly used for events (including parties and other evening events).
