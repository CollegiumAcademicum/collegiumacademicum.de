Would you like to get a taste of self-administration and live in a sustainable community? Then you've come to the right place here at the ecological and self-managed CA (Collegium Academicum) housing project.
    
Our old building combines a variety of living concepts. Our goal is to bring together different living environments and to enable more people to be able to be a part of communal, self-managed living. In addition to six social housing apartments and two independently financed apartments, the old building mainly provides living space for up to 50 participants in the falt*r orientation year. As this is currently not fully occupied, we rent out the remaining rooms to people who are looking for an interim rental, are only in Heidelberg for a limited time and/or would like to get a taste of our housing project without obligation.

Since we can not yet know how many participants the orientation year will have in the coming years, these rooms are temporary and can be terminated by us with 6-week notice to 30.09. of each year if they are needed for the participants of the orientation year falt*r.

The rooms advertised here are located on the 2nd and 3rd floors of our old building and are organized in corridor communities. All rooms can be rented with furniture.

All rooms have the following address: <br>
Ossip-Mandelstam-Straße 1 <br>
69126 Heidelberg-Rohrbach

An overview with floor plans, room sizes and rent levels can be found further down on this page.

The private living space is complemented by various rooms that are shared by the entire project: Workshops, assembly hall, multifunctional room, seminar rooms and workrooms. There is also central internet access and plenty of (garden) space for strolling around outside. The building uses an ecological construction method: This includes an insulation standard of KfW 55, interior walls made of straw, passive ventilation, triple-glazed windows and green electricity from its own roof.

You should be in the mood for a colorful house community. Due to our location on the US hospital conversion site, there is currently often a building site around us with the associated noise. There is also a large assembly hall in our new building next door, which is regularly used for events (including parties and other evening events).

## FAQ

{{< accordion "Questions about the flats" >}}

{{< accordion "Where are the shared apartments located?" >}}
The rooms are located together with the orientation year in our beautiful, energy-efficiently renovated old building right next to the dormitory. Together we form a large community that decides on its living space together and manages it itself. Four social rented flats are on the ground floor, two more on the 1st floor. The two unsubsidized flats are on the 2nd and 3rd floors.
