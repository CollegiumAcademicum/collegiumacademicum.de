<p>Awesome that you are interested in moving into our dormitory!

We always have vacant rooms at the beginning of a quarter (October 1, January 1, April 1 and July 1) for which we are looking for new roommates. Unfortunately, we can no longer accept applications for the move-in in October 2023. The next possible move-in date is January 1, 2024. From the beginning of October you will find our application form on this site.

Here you can sign up for our moving-in newsletter. Then we will inform you directly as soon as the application process has started.</p>
