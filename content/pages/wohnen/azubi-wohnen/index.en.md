## Arriving Together – Successfully Completing Your Apprenticeship

<p style="text-align:justify;">At Collegium Academicum Heidelberg, we offer not only students but also apprentices a home - with individual support and guidance. Thanks to funding from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Labour, and Tourism Baden-Württemberg, we can provide a special offer to young people who move to Heidelberg for their dual vocational training: housing and apprenticeship support.</p>

## What Does “Housing and Apprenticeship Support” Mean?

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Starting an apprenticeship is exciting—and often challenging. Many young people move away from home for the first time, need to find their way in a new city, and organize their daily lives independently. Our mentors are here to support you:</p>


- **Support in daily life**: Assistance with practical matters such as dealing with authorities or household organization. 
- **Integration & Networking**: Help settling into Heidelberg, planning leisure activities, and building connections. 
- **Career Guidance**: Advice on questions about your apprenticeship, applications, or further education. 
- **Community & Exchange**: Regular meetings, workshops, and joint activities for all residents. 


This offer is aimed at everyone starting or already completing a dual vocational training program. You can take advantage of the offer whether you live in the CA dormitory or not.

## How Does the Funding Benefit You?

The Trainee Housing project is funded by the state of Baden-Württemberg. For you, this means:

- **Free Support**: You won't incur any additional costs for the guidance provided by our mentors. 
- **Individual Assistance**: Our mentors have time for your questions—whether about housing, your apprenticeship, or life in Heidelberg. 
- **Flexible Offers**: From workshops on application training to joint excursions—you help decide what happens. 

The project runs until **August 2027** and is scientifically monitored to continuously improve the services.

## Who Is This Offer For?

You can use the housing and apprenticeship support if you:

- Are starting or already completing a **dual vocational training program**, 
- Live in or are connected to the **Collegium Academicum dormitory**, 
- Are between **16 and 25 years old**. 

International apprentices who need support with integration and language acquisition are especially welcome.
