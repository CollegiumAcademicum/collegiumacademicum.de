<p style="text-align:justify">
We provide, design and manage housing for very different people.
Living in the <a href="/dorm">dorm</a> in the new building is linked to vocational or academic training,
so it is aimed at trainees, students and doctoral students.
<!--Our <a href="/orientation_year">orientation year falt*r</a> takes place in the old building.
In addition to career orientation and personal development, the participants are also encouraged to find their role in
society and to contribute to the social transformation.-->
In addition, there are six socially committed rental flats in the old building, which are intended for people with a certificate of eligibility for housing.
Last but not least, there is one large and one small unsubsidised flat in the old building. The only rental condition here
is to actively participate in the self-management of the old building.
