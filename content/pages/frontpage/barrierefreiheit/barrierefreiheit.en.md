In the area of a previous US army hospital in Heidelberg-Rohrbach, we are constructing a four-floored wooden dormitory. The project will accommodate 176 students, apprentices, and doctorands. The rooms are organized in flats of three or four rooms with a shared kitchen and bathroom. In the architecture, accessibility was an explicit concern, and we tried to have the house as barrier-free as possible.

At the moment we are open for applications for tenants of the first move-in in March 2022. We explicitly encourage students and apprentices with special needs for barrier-free living to apply.

You can find more information about the application at https://collegiumacademicum/en/moving-in/

### Access to the house and the flats

The complete house and all common areas are accessible barrier-free. The flats are reached with outside balcony corridors and an elevator (Door width min. 90cm). The elevator door as well as all entrances to the flats are without thresholds. The flat entrances are 125cm wide.

Steps in the building are marked accordingly.

### Access to the rooms

All doors inside the flats have a minimum width of 90cm and do not have a threshold. The bath door opens to the outside.

### Bathrooms

The bathrooms are identical barrier-free ready-made units. The basis for the concept is the "Ready-Standard" (https://readyhome.de). All bathrooms are prepared to be equipped with needed handles if necessary.

Four of the bathrooms will be equipped with handles and switches for the room door at first move. In all bathrooms, the toilets are approachable from one side, in some rooms from the left, and in some from the right.

The sinks in the bathrooms are wheelchair approachable and the showers are also flat without threshold. The area is at least 120cm x 120cm.

### Public transport

The dormitory is right next to the tram stop "Ortenauerstr.". Furthermore, we will provide two marked handicapped parking spots with a width of 2,75m.
