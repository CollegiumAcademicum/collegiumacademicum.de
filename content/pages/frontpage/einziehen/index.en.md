The construction of the new wooden building has already begun and will be finished in 2021. But a housing project will only become a house through the many people who make it a joyful and lively place. That is why we are looking for great people who want to live there with us!

If you are interested in sustainability, education and self-organisation, our address could become your address. Maybe you'll start studying in Heidelberg in 2021 and will be looking for an apartment? Or maybe you are enthusiastic about living in a large community? Or you may simply be looking for a change of scenery?

The most important for us is that you want to take your life into your own hands, together with other people. Make yourself familiar with our  [vision]({{< relref "/pages/ueber-uns/unser-leitbild" >}}) and the ["Mietshäusersyndikat"](https://www.syndikat.org/en/ ). If this fits to you, just sign up at the bottom of the page.

_P.S.:_ For all do-it-yourself enthusiasts and people who like to create things with their hands: the weather prospects seem to be positive. We are building some of the furniture and facade elements by ourselves in our in-house workshop. Therefore, we welcome anyone motivated to help us! This also applies, of course, to the many other tasks that have to be done for such a huge project as the CA. If you would like to move in and/ or already have time, please contact us:
