The construction of the new, wooden building has already begun and will be finished in 2021. But a housing project only becomes a housing project through the many people who make it a joyful and lively place. Therefore we are very interested in finding great people as soon as possible who want to live there with us.

If you are interested in sustainability, education and self-organisation, our address could become your address. Maybe you'll start studying in Heidelberg in 2021 and will be looking for an apartment? Or maybe you are enthusiastic about living in a large community? Or you may simply be looking for a change of scenery?

That you want to take your life together with other people into your own hands is the only important thing for us. Make yourself familiar with our [vision]({{< relref "/pages/ueber-uns/unser-leitbild" >}}) and the ["Mietshäusersyndikat"](https://www.syndikat.org/en/ ). If this fits to you, just sign up at the bottom of the page.

_P.S.:_ The weather forecast for hobbyists of all kinds and people enjoying do-it-yourself stuff is very good. We are building some of the furniture and facade elements by ourselves in our in-house workshop. Therefore, we welcome anyone motivated to help us! This also applies, of course, to the many other tasks that have to be done for such a huge project as the CA. If you would like to move in and/ or already have time, please contact us:
