{{< accordion "Does each flat have its own washing machine?" >}}
No, except the flat-mates would setup one themselves. The house has a separate central washing lounge with enough washing machines for all residents. We think a shared washing lounge is a more sufficient approach and saves all residents space and costs.

Each kitchen comes equipped with a stove, oven, fridge and a kitchen top with a sink. Additional the kitchen has a table and chairs. All wooden furniture is made in-house!

### Questions about the application

{{< accordion "I am not yet a student or trainee, can I apply for a place?" >}}
Yes! You can apply before getting your student or trainee status. It is necessary though, that at your moving in day, you are enrolled in your program. If in the mean time it turns out that you cannot start your study program / apprenticeship, you can step back from your letter of intent without any costs.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "I'm interested, but I don't know if there are any places left. Should I still apply?" >}}
Yes, we are still looking for many new residents for the move-in in at the end of July or in August 2022! So get to work and send us your application! We would also be happy if you told other people about us who might also be interested in moving in.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "Does the application cost anything?" >}}
No! The application does not cost you anything. If your are invited for a get-to-know-you day, we cannot reimburse your travel costs, sadly. *(Note: Because of the current situation, all get-to-knows are held online anyway!)*
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "I am under eighteen, can I apply anyway?" >}}
Yes, this is not a problem. For the letter of intent and the rental contract you will need a parent that can co-sign both documents.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "Can I apply now already if I only want to move in for the Winter semester 2022/2023?" >}}
No, right now we are focussing on finding the first residents that are moving in at the end of July or in August 2022. If you want to move in later, you should come back to us at a later time.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "I have supported the project by giving a direct loan before. Do I or my children/relatives have an advantage with moving in?" >}}
No! Financial support does not have any influence on who can move in. The financial background should not have any effect whether somebody  can be part of this community or not.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "According to which criterions will the residents be choosen?" >}}
Given that the formal requirements are met (status as a student, docotral student of trainee) we are searching for people that can identify with our mission statement, that want to engage in the self-organization of the dormitory and want to take up responsiblity for the community.

### Questions about moving in and the living together

{{< accordion "When can I first move in into the building?" >}}
As we are currently constructing the building, we can sadly not guarentee are precise fixed moving in date. Given our current plan, the moving-in day will at the end of July or August 2022.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "Can I choose my flatmates?" >}}
Yes! As soon as you get accepted for a room in the house, you can start engaging with other people accepted for a room. In this process you can form your own shared flats of three or four persons each. We will support you in that process, of course.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "Can I bring my pet?" >}}
No, in the dormitory pets are not currently allowed. An exception to this are assistance pets.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "Is it possible that the project fails, before the building is finished?" >}}
Given our current construction and financial situation, we think this possibility for this are extremely slim.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "Can I bring my own furniture?" >}}
Each room is always rented furnished (desk, wardrobe, bed). For the first occupancy at the end of July or in August 2022, there is the possibility to bring your own furniture if you wish. In this case, the basic furniture will be handed over to the CA for the duration of the stay (in the form of a donation, deposit or free rent - what exactly is possible will be discussed again with Eberhard). The furnishing surcharge of 20€ remains included in the rent in any case. A list is kept of the intentions of those moving in to donate their furniture temporarily/long-term. A working group must guarantee that furniture will be available when new residents move in.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "Do I have to give the project money or a loan to move in?" >}}
No! Financial support does not have any influence on who can move in. The financial background should not have any effect whether somebody  can be part of this community or not.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "Does the house have special family flats for families with children?" >}}
There are no specific family flats. Nevertheless it is possible to move in with children. Each room has to be rented by a student/trainee. Therefore for example, two rooms could be rented by the two parents, then live together in one of the rooms and use the other as a child room. Of course, a child could also live together with a parent in the their room.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "I am a single parent. Can I move in?" >}}
Yes, you can. Take note though of the formal requirement that each room has to be rented by a student or trainee. See the question above.
{{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "Do I have to help with the construction of the house?" >}}
No! Nevertheless we appreciate of course any help with the work necessary to finish the house. These topics include, the construction of the furniture, publicity work and the organization of the projects financials. However, support from those moving in is sensible and desirable, especially with regard to the future self-administration, and in order to be able to manage the move-in.
